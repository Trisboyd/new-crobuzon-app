### Description
In late 2020 I became intrigued by the writings of China Mieville after reading his novel "Perdido Street Station."  Fascinated by the world-building
in his works, I decided to create a website to help readers and fans gain a better understanding of the city of New Crobuzon and
it's inhabitants. This website allows the user to read small bits about multiple districts and landmarks in the city as well as several species
that exist there. Should the user feel so inclined, there are also links to purchase the books that describe and tell tales of this world.
Warning, some small spoilers lie in the information you see.
